1.Explain the difference between FIFO and Capacity scheduler.

      The differences between FIFO and capacity scheduler are:        

          *FIFO is First In First Out. The job which enters the queue first is executed first.          

          * In FIFO scheduling if the oldest job is long then the shortest jobs get stuck behind the longest ones.

          * In FIFO scheduling the jobs are taken from the work queue. The jobs are taken in the order of the 
            oldest job first. 

          * In FIFO there is a poor utilization of the job queue and it has costly data replication.

          * Whereas in the capacity scheduling several queues are created with each having a number of map
             and reduce tasks.

          * FIFO scheduling does not deals with  the size or priority of the job.

          * Unlike FIFO the shortest jobs are assigned first and then the longest one.

          *  Capacity scheduler  supports multiple queues. In this each queue is assigned a capacity.
           
          * The capacity of the individual queue is then added together to find the overall capacity of the cluster.

          * Free resources can be allocated to queues beyond its capacity.
          
          * Jobs with higher priorities have more access compared to lower priority jobs in capacity scheduler.



2.What are the limitations of hadoop 1.x and how they were overcome in hadoop 2.x

       The limitations of hadoop 1.x are given as follows:

          * The major limitation of hadoop 1.x is that it supports only the map reduce based on batch and 
            data processing.

          * Hadoop 1.x does not support horizontal scalability.

          * Hadoop 1.x is not suitable for real time data processing.
          
          * In hadoop 1.x only one namenode is used.  If the name node fails then the entire cluster fails and
            this is called Single Point of failure(SPOF) in hadoop 1.x.         

      Hadoop 2.x overcomes limitation of hadoop 1.x by:
          
          * Hadoop 2.x uses a new YARN component.

          * Hadoop 2.x supports the horizontal scalability.

          * It supports multiple name space and multiple namenodes.
            and an application master component 
          
          * It decouples the responsibility of the mapreduce components into different components.

          * It provides high availability and high scalability. 

          * Hadoop 2.x has and an application master component, resource manager component, node manager 
            component which makes it more useful.
